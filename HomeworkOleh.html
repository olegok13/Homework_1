    <ul><b>Naruto Uzumaki (うずまきナルト, Uzumaki Naruto)</b> is a shinobi of Konohagakure's Uzumaki clan. He
        became the jinchūriki of the Nine-Tails on the day of his birth — a fate that caused him to be shunned
        by most
        of Konoha throughout his childhood. After joining Team Kakashi,
        Naruto worked hard to gain the village's acknowledgement all the
        while chasing his dream to become Hokage.In the following years, through many hardships and ordeals, he became a
        capable ninja regarded as a hero both by the villagers, and soon after, the rest of the world, becoming known as
        the Hero of the Hidden Leaf (木ノ葉隠れの英雄, Konohagakure no Eiyū, literally meaning: Hero of the Hidden Tree Leaves).
        He soon proved to be one of the main factors in winning the Fourth Shinobi World War, leading him to achieve his
        dream and become the village's Seventh Hokage (七代目火影, Nanadaime Hokage, literally meaning: Seventh Fire Shadow).

    <h2>Six Paths: Ultra-Big Ball Rasenshuriken</h2>
    <ul>This is the alpha and omega when it comes to Naruto's Rasenshuriken, strong enough to counter Sasuke's most
        powerful attack when the two did battle to close Shippudden. It combines the power of the Six Paths and all
        of
        his knowledge of Rasenshuriken to create a maneuver strong enough that it can create a vortex so strong that
        it
        resembles a black hole.
